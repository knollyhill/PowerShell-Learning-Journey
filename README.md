# PowerShell-Learning-Journey

Welcome to my public PowerShell learning repository! This repo documents my hands-on journey toward mastering PowerShell, improving day-to-day automation skills, and becoming more proficient with GitHub workflows.

## 🔍 Purpose

This repository is a collection of scripts, notes, and mini-projects inspired by:

- **John Savill’s PowerShell Training Series**
- **_Learn PowerShell in a Month of Lunches_** by Don Jones & Jeffrey Hicks
- Real-world scenarios from my IT/System Administrator experience

The goal is to **sharpen my scripting ability**, **automate tasks**, and **continuously learn** through version-controlled work.

## 📁 Structure

- `scripts/` – Practical PowerShell scripts for real-world tasks
- `projects/` – Self-contained automation projects or labs
- `notes/` – Summaries, learning points, and resources
- `experiments/` – Scratchpad for testing new concepts

## 🧠 Topics Covered (So Far)

- PowerShell basics and syntax
- Working with objects and pipelines
- Scripting logic (loops, conditionals, error handling)
- File, registry, and system management
- GitHub workflow basics for script versioning
- Automation tasks from real job use cases

## 📈 Long-Term Goals

- Build a solid PowerShell foundation
- Confidently create automation scripts for daily IT tasks
- Contribute to internal tooling and larger projects
- Grow a public portfolio that reflects my experiences with PowerShell

## 📬 Feedback & Collaboration

Suggestions, pull requests, and feedback are welcome—especially from others learning PowerShell or working in infrastructure/automation roles.
